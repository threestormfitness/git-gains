## Module Breakdown

Wendler's 5/3/1 is a percentage-based program that focuses on slow but steady progression. The program operates on a four-week cycle, with each week having a specific rep scheme and intensity. The key to the program is using a Training Max (TM), which is typically 85-90% of your true 1RM.

The "+" on the final set indicates an AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible) set. This is where you push yourself to get as many quality reps as possible with the prescribed weight.

### Training Max (TM) Calculation
1. Take your true 1RM (one rep maximum)
2. Multiply it by 0.85-0.90 to get your Training Max
3. Use this TM to calculate all working weights

### Progression
- After completing a full 4-week cycle, increase your Training Max by:
  - 5 lbs for upper body lifts (Bench Press, Overhead Press)
  - 10 lbs for lower body lifts (Squat, Deadlift)

### Example (Bench Press with 225 lbs 1RM)
Using 90% for TM calculation:
- Training Max = 225 × 0.9 = 202.5 lbs (round to 200)

#### Week 1 (3x5)
- Set 1: 130 lbs (65% of 200)
- Set 2: 150 lbs (75% of 200)
- Set 3: 170 lbs (85% of 200) for 5+ reps

#### Week 2 (3x3)
- Set 1: 140 lbs (70% of 200)
- Set 2: 160 lbs (80% of 200)
- Set 3: 180 lbs (90% of 200) for 3+ reps

#### Week 3 (5/3/1)
- Set 1: 150 lbs (75% of 200)
- Set 2: 170 lbs (85% of 200)
- Set 3: 190 lbs (95% of 200) for 1+ reps

#### Week 4 (Deload)
- Set 1: 80 lbs (40% of 200)
- Set 2: 100 lbs (50% of 200)
- Set 3: 120 lbs (60% of 200)

## Quick Stats
### Goals
- Strength
- Power
- Long-term progression

### Training Age
- Intermediate
- Advanced

### Origin
- Jim Wendler (2009)

### Time to complete (does not include warmup)
- 15-20 min for main lifts
- 30-45 min including assistance work

## Warmup Suggestion
For each main lift:
1. Empty bar × 10 reps
2. 40% of TM × 5 reps
3. 50% of TM × 5 reps
4. 60% of TM × 3 reps

## Notes
- The program is typically run for the four main lifts: Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift, and Overhead Press
- Each main lift is trained once per week
- Assistance work should be added after the main lifts (50-100 reps each of Push, Pull, and Single Leg/Core exercises)
- The AMRAP sets are crucial for driving progress and autoregulating intensity
- If you hit more than 5 reps on your 1+ week, consider using a higher Training Max
- Rest periods can be adjusted based on individual recovery needs
