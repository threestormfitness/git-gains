## Module Breakdown

Initiate your training with a weight that makes completing 8 repetitions challenging yet achievable while maintaining proper form—a weight that is around your 10-12 rep max (10RM) is a solid benchmark to start with. Perform 3 sets of these 8 repetitions, allowing yourself a rest period of approximately 120 seconds between each set to recover.

In your subsequent workout session, which typically occurs a week later or whenever you next engage in this specific exercise, aim to complete 3 sets of 10 repetitions using the same weight. Progress to attempting 3 sets of 12 repetitions in the workout that follows. Successfully performing 3 sets of 12 indicates it's time to increase the weight for your next session and revert to starting with 8 reps. This progression cycle is designed to gradually enhance your strength, size and endurance by systematically increasing the workload. Continue this cycle, adjusting the weight as you successfully meet the targets, to steadily progress in your training.

### Example
#### Workout 1
- **Dumbbell bench press:** 3 x 8 @ 50 lbs DBs
#### Workout 2
- **Dumbbell bench press:** 3 x 10 @ 50 lbs DBs
#### Workout 3
- **Dumbbell bench press:** 3 x 12 @ 50 lbs DBs
#### Workout 4
- **Dumbbell bench press:** 3 x 8 @ 55 lbs DBs

## Warmup Suggestion
Here's a suggested warmup sequence.  These are rough suggestions.  You may add or subtract sets, depending on where you are in your workout:
- 1st Set: 12 reps @ 40% of work set weight
- 2nd Set: 10 reps @ 50% of work set weight
- 3rd Set: 8 reps @ 60% of work set weight
- 4th Set: 4 reps @ 80% of work set weight

## Contingency Planning

### Faster Progression
It's acceptable to stick with the planned steady progression, even if it feels quite manageable (a conservative approach). However, for those seeking to accelerate their progression, borrowing strategies from Autoregulatory Progressive Resistance Exercise (APRE) can be beneficial. 

On the final set of the third workout in the cycle (3 x 12), complete as many reps as possible with good form.  Use the table below to determine how much weight to add.

**APRE Table for Guidance:**

| Reps Completed | Weight Adjustment |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| 0-2 over rep target | Increase by 5-10 lbs |
| 3-4 over rep target | Increase by 10-15 lbs |
| 5+ over rep target | Increase by 15-20 lbs |

#### Example for Faster Progression
If during Workout 3 you complete more than 12 reps (say, 15 reps), using the APRE table you would increase the weight by 10-15 lbs for the next session instead of the usual 5 lbs.

### Plateau Busting
If you find yourself stalling on reps—unable to complete the targeted reps for a set—consider the following strategies:

#### Scale Back
If you're unable to complete all targeted reps, scale back to the weight where you last completed all sets successfully.

##### Example for Scaling Back
If stalling at Workout 2:
- Attempted Dumbbell bench press: 3 x 10 @ 55 lbs DBs but only managed 9 reps on the last set.
- Next session, revert to Dumbbell bench press: 3 x 8 @ 50 lbs DBs and work back up.

#### Switch Exercises
Switching to a similar exercise can refresh your training stimulus and help overcome plateaus.

##### Example for Switching Exercises
If stalling at Workout 3:
- Dumbbell bench press: 3 x 12 @ 55 lbs DBs not completed.
- Switch to Incline Dumbbell Bench Press: 3 x 8 @ ~10RM and restart the cycle.

#### Increase Sets
If you're close to your rep target but not quite there, increase the number of sets while keeping the weight constant.

##### Example for Increasing Sets
If stalling at Workout 3:
- Dumbbell bench press: 3 x 12 @ 55 lbs DBs, achieved 11 reps.
- Next session, Dumbbell bench press: 4 x 8 @ 55 lbs DBs, then progress as usual.

## Other Info
### How to find your 10 RM
#### Use a rep max calculator
If you know *any* rep max for this particular movement, plug it into a rep max calculator and check the table to find your suggested 10 RM.  The close the rep max you use to 10, the more accurate your results will be (e.g., using your know 8 RM for finding your 10 RM will likely be more accurate than using your 2 RM).
##### Example for using a rep max calculator
If you recently tested yourself, and found that you can complete 8 reps @ 205 lbs, enter your numbers into a calculator (like the one found here: https://strengthlevel.com/one-rep-max-calculator).  You'll find that your 10 RM is approximately 190 lbs.  

*Note: When it doubt, start with less*
#### Work up to your 10 RM
Start at a weight at which you know you can easily complete 10 reps.  Add a little bit of weight each set until 10 reps is all you can do.  Rest about 120 seconds in between sets. 

*Note: if you your final set is close to 10 reps, but not exact (e.g., 9 or 11 reps), use the rep max calculator method above to get a more accurate figure, or err conservatively and start light.*
