### Notes:

- **Weight Adjustments:** The weights listed are starting points. Adjust based on your own strength level and the principle of progressive overload. As you complete 3 sets of 12 comfortably, increase the weight for the next session and return to 3 sets of 8 reps.
- **Rest Periods:** Ensure you're taking a full 120 seconds of rest between each set for optimal recovery.
